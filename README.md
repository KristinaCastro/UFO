## Overview of the analysis:
Scenario : Dana is a data journalist who has been given the opportunity to write about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. She has decided to write about what her town is most famous for, UFO sightings. The best way for Dana to display all her UFO sighting details is to create a webpage with an interactive table allowing users to search by filtering for multiple criteria at the same time i.e date, city, state, country, and shape.


Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
